# Pokemon Simulator
- Built using Qt Creator and C++ for the code, this personal project is me wanting to develop a very basic Pokemon simulator.
- The backend is stored onto a Postgres database whose static Pokemon data was retrieved via the use of https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.
- For pokemon retrieval, an API call will be used to run a query that will retrieve the pokemon from the backend.
- Moves, abilities, levels, catch rate are all stored.
- The current implementation is the trainer starting out with Treecko, and then the trainer is on a "Route 1" field where they can battle 8 different wild pokemon.
